/**
 * The context for a command execution.
 *
 * The `Context` serves as the orchestrator for the entire command lifecycle. It
 * is responsible for initializing the CLI environment, resolving commands,
 * parsing options, and managing execution flow. It ensures that all aspects of
 * the CLI are prepared and ready before any action is taken, establishing a
 * predictable and stable execution environment.
 *
 * Philosophy:
 * - Immutable Configuration: Once the context is prepared, its configuration
 *   should not change. This immutability guarantees consistency throughout the
 *   CLI's operation and avoids side effects that could arise from dynamic
 *   changes in the environment.
 * - Explicit Lifecycle Management: By clearly defining lifecycle hooks and
 *   preparation stages, `Context` offers explicit control over the command
 *   execution process, allowing for extensibility and customization without
 *   sacrificing predictability.
 * - Separation of Concerns: `Context` focuses on the setup and execution
 *   environment, while {@linkcode State} manages the actual progression and
 *   state changes during command execution. This separation ensures that each
 *   module only handles its designated responsibilities, making the system
 *   easier to maintain and extend.
 * - Fail-fast Philosophy: The context should catch and handle errors as early
 *   as possible (during the preparation phase), ensuring that execution only
 *   proceeds when all systems are nominal. The exception to this rule is option
 *   validation, which is performed dynamically when options are accessed during
 *   execution. This is done to give command handlers the ability to gracefully
 *   handle missing or invalid options and potentially prompt the user for the
 *   missing information.
 *
 * Scope:
 * - Plugin Initialization: Loading and preparing all plugins for the execution
 *   cycle.
 * - Command Resolution: Determining the sequence of command modules to be
 *   executed based on the input string.
 * - Option Parsing: Interpreting command-line arguments and flags into a
 *   structured format for consumption by commands.
 * - Execution Readiness: Ensuring that the context has been fully prepared
 *   before allowing the execution to proceed.
 * - Error Management: Providing a centralized mechanism for error handling
 *   during the preparation and execution phases.
 * - Exit Management: Providing a centralized mechanism for exiting the CLI.
